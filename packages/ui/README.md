## UI

This package provides a comprehensive set of reusable UI components built with React, Radix UI primitives, and Tailwind CSS. It includes modern, accessible components for common UI patterns such as forms, navigation, dialogs, and data display.

## Structure

- **Components** are built using Radix UI primitives for accessibility and behavior
- **Styling** uses Tailwind CSS with a custom design system and CSS variables
- **Theming** supports light/dark modes with semantic color tokens
- **Utilities** include helper functions for consistent styling and class merging
- **Type Safety** with full TypeScript support and proper component prop types

## Features

- **Accessibility First** - Built on Radix UI primitives with ARIA compliance
- **Dark Mode Support** - Automatic theme switching with CSS variables
- **Modern Design System** - Uses OKLCH color space for consistent theming
- **Animation Support** - Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with consistent breakpoints
- **TypeScript Native** - Full type safety with proper component interfaces

## Notes

- Components are designed to be composable and flexible
- All interactive elements include proper ARIA attributes
- The design system uses OKLCH color space for better perceptual uniformity
- Components support both controlled and uncontrolled usage patterns
- CSS variables enable runtime theme switching without JavaScript
